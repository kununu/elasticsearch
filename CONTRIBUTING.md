# Contributing

Contributions are more than **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/kununu/elasticsearch).

## Pull Requests

- **[kununu Coding Standards](https://github.com/kununu/kununu-scripts)** - The kununu coding standards are an extension of the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/). Check out [kununu Coding Standards](https://github.com/kununu/kununu-scripts) for more details. In development mode the package [kununu-scripts](https://github.com/kununu/kununu-scripts) is already a dependency that expose commands that you can use to meet our standards.

- **Add tests!** - to ensure a high quality code base, your code patch can't be accepted if it does not have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md), [README.md](README.md) and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - Since we're using semantic versioning ([SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/)). Changes to the API must be done with great consideration, and prevented if at all possible.

- **Create feature branches** - Master is the stable branch, create a new branch for each feature.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Be respectful** - Be excellent to other contributors.
